# 🛡️ Admin Control System for Dashboard

## 📋 Overview

The dashboard uses a **dual-update system**:
- **Admin-Controlled Items**: Require manual approval for security
- **Automatic Items**: Update in real-time from user activities

## 🔐 Admin-Controlled Dashboard Items

### 1. 💰 **Total Balance** (Critical - Admin Approval Required)

#### User Flow:
1. User submits deposit request with payment proof
2. Status: "Pending Admin Approval" 
3. **Admin reviews and approves/rejects**
4. ✅ **Only after approval**: Balance updates on dashboard

#### Backend API Flow:
```javascript
// User deposits (creates pending deposit)
POST /financial/deposit
{
  "amount": 1000,
  "paymentMethod": "bank_transfer",
  "paymentProof": "base64_image_or_file_url",
  "transactionRef": "TXN123456"
}

// Admin gets pending deposits
GET /admin/pending-deposits
Response: [
  {
    "depositId": "dep_123",
    "userId": "user_456", 
    "amount": 1000,
    "paymentProof": "...",
    "submittedAt": "2025-09-29T10:00:00Z",
    "status": "pending"
  }
]

// Admin approves deposit
POST /admin/approve-deposit/dep_123
{
  "adminNote": "Payment verified"
}

// This updates user's dashboard balance immediately
```

#### Dashboard Behavior:
- **Before Approval**: Shows current balance only
- **Pending Indicator**: "1 deposit pending admin approval"  
- **After Approval**: Balance updates automatically + notification

### 2. ✅ **Account Status** (Critical - Admin Approval Required)

#### User Flow:
1. User uploads KYC documents (ID, proof of address, selfie)
2. Status: "PENDING" 
3. **Admin reviews documents and approves/rejects**
4. ✅ **Only after approval**: Status changes to "VERIFIED"

#### Backend API Flow:
```javascript
// User submits KYC
POST /auth/kyc
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "idDocument": "base64_image",
  "proofOfAddress": "base64_image", 
  "selfie": "base64_image"
}

// Admin gets pending KYC
GET /admin/pending-kyc
Response: [
  {
    "userId": "user_456",
    "documents": {...},
    "submittedAt": "2025-09-29T10:00:00Z",
    "status": "pending"
  }
]

// Admin approves KYC
POST /admin/approve-kyc/user_456
{
  "adminNote": "Documents verified"
}

// This updates user's account status immediately
```

#### Dashboard Behavior:
- **UNVERIFIED**: Red chip, user can't withdraw
- **PENDING**: Orange chip, "KYC pending admin approval"
- **VERIFIED**: Green chip, full access

### 3. 🎁 **Total Bonus** (Admin Action Only)

#### Admin Flow:
1. **Admin decides to give bonus** (referral, promotion, etc.)
2. **Admin enters bonus amount and reason**
3. ✅ **Immediately updates** user's dashboard

#### Backend API Flow:
```javascript
// Admin gives bonus
POST /admin/give-bonus/user_456
{
  "amount": 100,
  "reason": "Referral bonus",
  "type": "referral"
}

// This immediately updates user's Total Bonus
```

---

### 4. 💸 **Withdrawals** (Admin Approval Required)

#### User Flow:
1. User requests withdrawal
2. Status: "Pending Admin Approval"
3. **Admin verifies user balance and legitimacy**
4. ✅ **Only after approval**: Money sent + balance deducted

#### Backend API Flow:
```javascript
// User requests withdrawal
POST /financial/withdraw
{
  "amount": 500,
  "method": "bank_transfer",
  "bankDetails": {...}
}

// Admin gets pending withdrawals
GET /admin/pending-withdrawals

// Admin approves withdrawal
POST /admin/approve-withdrawal/with_123

}
```
